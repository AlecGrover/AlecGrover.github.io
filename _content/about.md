I'm an experienced gameplay systems engineer focused on building systems that keep players engaged, invested, and feeling genuinely rewarded. With battle-tested experience in MMO development, I've worked through the full cycle of a live service game, from early prototypes to launch and beyond.

My development approach comes from a healthy mix of hard earned technical expertise, an undying love of games and the art of what makes them compelling, and a strong desire to be a technical bridge between engineering and design. Whether I'm building analytics and telemetry, engineering safeguards for live systems, or laying the bones of gameplay systems, I believe that communication and a relentless drive to learn more can build incredible things.

When I'm not making games, you'll find me playing my D&D rogue in a nearly decade long campaign, out walking to find yet another new coffee shop, or, more than likely, *playing* a game rather than making it.
