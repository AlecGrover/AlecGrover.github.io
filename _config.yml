meta_author: Grover Alec
about-left: My name is Alec Grover and I’m a software engineer with a Computer Science degree from Simon Fraser University and a deep passion for all things gaming. My experience spans a broad variety of engines and languages including Unreal, Unity, PyGame, C++, C#, Java, Python, and many more, and I am always looking to learn and grow further!
about-right: Games have always been a big part of who I am. From my earliest memories of my cousins handing me a controller while they played Halo CE, to the years spent building and running Minecraft servers, all the way through today, games have profoundly impacted me. I could think of nothing better than making the platforms to inspire the next generation.
