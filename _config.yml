about-left: Alec Grover is a Canadian software engineer and game developer. He recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and is excited to be starting out into the games industry. Alec is very experienced in C# and Unity, and he is currently working with C++ and Unreal to further bolster his development background.
about-right: Games have always been a big part of who I am. From my earliest memories of my cousins handing me a controller while they played Halo CE, to the years spent building and running Minecraft servers, all the way through today, games have profoundly impacted me. I could think of nothing better than making the platforms to inspire the next generation.
