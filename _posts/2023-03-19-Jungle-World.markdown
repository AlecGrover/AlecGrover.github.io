description: In early 2023, I did the engineering work on an interactive companion project for a music video. The interactive space was showcased at an exclusive invite only release event in Atlanta for 300 of the artist's guests and included elements of the music video, a behind the scenes showcase area, and an interactive shooting range using an upgraded version of my previous shooting range module.
