description: Race Engineer simulator is my active personal project game. Inspired by my own love of motorsports and Formula 1, RES features a unique experience in which you don't get to control the driver. Call strategies, time your pit stops, choose your tires, and guide your driver to victory lane! RES features a fully custom opponent AI and a unique non-physical race simulation that will give you a challenge while keeping things fresh every time.
