## Project Overview

As a gameplay systems engineer working primarily with the economy team and later the wider systems team, I developed and owned key systems including inland fishing, gear tempering, and crafting recipe validation, among numerous others. As one of only two gameplay engineers permanently assigned to the economy, I worked in tight collaboration with the team's lead engineer and designers across a wide range of interconnected systems. I guided core high-risk economy elements through every lifecycle stage from prototyping, through release, and to continuing live operations support.

## Core Contributions

### Live Service MMO Economy & Progression

Owned core economy and character progression systems, taking many from their ground level technical proposals all the way to live game operations supporting in excess of 25,000 CCU:

- Developed highly visible item modification systems including tempering, gem socketing, deconstruction, crafter attribution, and sport fishing fish sizing data

- Contributed to key high-risk and asynchronous elements of crafting, processing, and gathering systems including serverside verification and clientside prediction

- Designed and built core gameplay functionality including key contributions to inland fishing, hunting, and a unique dynamic set bonus system


### Feature Flagging and Safeguarding Production Gameplay Systems

Key contributor to defensive systems protecting a volatile live game environment:

- Individually defined, integrated, and maintained documentation for 75+ feature flags representing over half of the total number of production flags

- Championed system-level protections and led technical investigations into economy vulnerabilities to develop preemptive solutions

- Provided real time support to live operations teams to protect the in-game economy and support rapid recovery from critical incidents


### Inter-Server Gameplay and Economy Integration

Contributed extensively to hardening economy systems within a one-of-a-kind dynamic server gridding architecture:

- Implemented cross-server communication and validation systems supporting crafting, processing, and gathering professions

- Developed an octree based foliage tracking solution to support our resource surveying and spawning systems in a dynamically partitioned world

- Ensured critical economy systems were seamlessly secure in highly asynchronous and unpredictable networking conditions where classic single-server assumptions did not hold


### Analytics, Telemetry, & Forensics

Primary engineer responsible for economy telemetry and forensics data metrics:

- Designed and integrated dozens of high-profile analytics systems tracking everything from player trades and marketplace transactions to equipment swapping and player deaths

- Provided front line support to design in extracting actionable data, including writing scripting tools to bulk analyze results

- Worked on highest priority strike teams to track and resolve breaches like duplication exploits, malicious actors, and RMT activity


### Enabled Designers to Build With Data Driven Systems

Built well-structured, customizable, and data driven systems to empower designers:

- Worked extensively to build connections between designer facing tools and in game systems

- Handled engineering work to enable deeply impactful systems including reward rolls, vendor price calculation, and experience handling

- Supported extensive iteration on critical data structures while preserving system safety and version continuity
