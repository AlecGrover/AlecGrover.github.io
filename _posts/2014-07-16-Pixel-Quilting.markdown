description: A modified implementation of the computational photography paper *Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer*, this project was created to test an alternative to tilemaps for stochastic texture fields. By randomly generating unique texture paths Pixel Quilting can produce non-repeating textures of arbitrary size from a single 64x64 texture sample in near realtime. Check out the video for more details!
