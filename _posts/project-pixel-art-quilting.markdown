## Image Quilting

This term project from one of my final courses in my Computer Science degree remains a unique high point in my career. Built in a team of two, and partnered with the only other undergraduate in a primarily graduate course, we implemented a modified version of the computational photography paper "Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer" to produce an alternative for tilemaps.

Due to the extremely small original image, a single 64x64 pixel art texture, we were able to generate arbitrary size stochastic texture fields in near real time. This produced contextually consistent and non-repeating pixel art as a solution to the classic development problem of texture aliasing.

You can find the project video [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlIj6dGaGUo), and the project code [here on GitHub](https://github.com/berkeliboz/Image-Quilting-for-Texture-Synthesis-and-Transfer).
