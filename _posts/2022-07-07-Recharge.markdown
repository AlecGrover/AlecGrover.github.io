category: Arena FPS
description: A high-speed arena shooter inspired by both iconic 1v1 games like Quake
and by modern velocity shooters like Titanfall 2, Recharge will be a unique twist on
the classic FPS. Players compete to fully "recharge" by hitting opponents with their
beam weapon, upon reaching 100% charge, they are uploaded, which scores them a point
and respawns them. This inversion of the standard system aims to create a 1v1 dueler
where players can't achieve dominance through fortuitous map control alone, placing
the victor in the recovery position after each duel.
