description: After coming to the alarming realization that I had no clue what half the things on the Starbucks menu were, I turned to the best medium I knew to bridge that gap; making a game about it. Coffee shop is a simple web game about working at a cafe. It's currently undergoing a major redesign, and I'm hoping to use some of the techniques I've learnt from my more recent games to turn it into something really cool!
