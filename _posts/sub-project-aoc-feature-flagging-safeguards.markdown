## Recovery for When Prevention Fails

As Ashes of Creation transitioned to a live product, reactive safeguards became critical to preventing emergent issues from destabilizing the game's economy. I owned many of these recovery focused features and worked extensively with live operations to identify, triage, and mitigate incidents in the critical window between discovery and the deployment of a permanent fix.

## Feature Flags

Feature flags were the primary tool for containing high severity issues, and I was responsible for the development, integration, and documentation of over half of the project's production flags. I advocated strongly for granular, surgical flagging to minimize impact on player experience and game feel while still allowing for comprehensive and rapid intervention, particularly in the tightly coupled economy and progression systems.

As the primary engineer overseeing flags for professions, currency transactions, and player progression, I strategically identified weak points and built safeguards ahead of live incidents. I also maintained exhaustive documentation and worked closely with Community Service teams, GMs, and leadership to ensure that issues were handled quickly and correctly.

## Analytics and Recovery Support

Live incidents at MMO scale inevitably require complex recovery decisions. A core responsibility I held was supporting design and live operations teams in assessing incident scope and determining recovery plans. 

I contributed to recovery operations and post-mortems for major incidents including exploits, duplication bugs, and data loss scenarios, working alongside on-call teams and senior stakeholders. In these scenarios, I consistently pushed for solutions that emphasized maintaining player trust and respect for player time and investment.
