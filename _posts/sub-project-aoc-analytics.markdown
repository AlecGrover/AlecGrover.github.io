## Finding Patterns in the Noise

As the engineer in charge of the gameplay layer integration of economy analytics data, I worked closely with economy design and the studio's database team to develop and integrate dozens of data tracking solutions. I worked on systems ranging from simple error tracking, to business insights for balance changes, and all the way to forensics data for tracking and actioning bad actors.

## Analytics & Business Insights

In an environment as variable as an MMO, no economy can be developed without constant monitoring and balance changes. The economy analytics gameplay layer that I built enabled the design team to address these key issues. I developed analytics tracking for each of our core economy systems and tackled complex issues of data linking between disparate functionalities to create a comprehensive picture of the entire economic ecosystem. Through a network of transaction and instance GUIDs, I built a system that allowed for efficient and targeted access of key data metrics, minimizing duplicate or unnecessary data in query returns.

## Forensics

MMO economies face a constant threat from bad actors. Organized and experienced groups target key systems to attempt exploits or fuel RMT activity. These actors do not report bugs, yet are some of the most effective and efficient at locating them. Through our economy analytics systems, I developed logging and analytics stacks designed to allow for detailed after-action tracking of illegitimate goods and discovery of crucial evidence and patterns to identify problematic users. These solutions were utilized heavily by Community Service teams and senior stakeholders in the issuing of disciplinary action up to and including permanent bans.
